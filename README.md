# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# task-todo
Develop a Redux-powered To-Do List application with filtering capabilities to help users efficiently manage their tasks. The application should allow users to add, mark as completed, delete, and filter tasks based on their status." The goal is to demonstrate state management using Redux Toolkit while integrating Bootstrap for a clean UI experience.
User Stories
User Story 1: Add Tasks
📌 As a user, I want to add a new task to my to-do list, so that I can keep track of things I need to do.
✅ Acceptance Criteria:
The user can enter text into an input field.
Clicking the "Add" button adds the task to the list.
The task should appear in the "All" and "Pending" filter views.
User Story 2: Mark Task as Completed
📌 As a user, I want to mark a task as completed, so that I know which tasks are done.
✅ Acceptance Criteria:
Clicking on a task toggles its status between completed and pending.
A completed task should have a strikethrough effect and a success badge (Completed).
A pending task should have a warning badge (Pending).
🔹 User Story 3: Delete a Task
📌 As a user, I want to delete a task from the list, so that I can remove unnecessary tasks.
✅ Acceptance Criteria:
Clicking the ❌ button next to a task should remove it from the list.
The deleted task should no longer appear in any filter view.
🔹 User Story 4: Filter Tasks by Status
📌 As a user, I want to filter tasks by status (All, Completed, Pending), so that I can view tasks based on their progress.
✅ Acceptance Criteria:
Clicking "All" displays all tasks.
Clicking "Completed" shows only tasks that are marked as done.
Clicking "Pending" shows only tasks that are not completed.
🔹 User Story 5: Responsive UI with Bootstrap
📌 As a user, I want a visually appealing and responsive interface, so that I can easily interact with my to-do list on different devices.
✅ Acceptance Criteria:
The layout should be responsive on desktops, tablets, and mobile screens.
Bootstrap buttons, forms, and list groups should be used for styling.
The UI should be clean and intuitive.
